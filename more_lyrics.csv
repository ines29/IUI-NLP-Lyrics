0;Girls Just Want to Have Fun; Cyndi Lauper ;"I come home, in the morning light
My mother says ""When you gonna live your life right?""
Oh momma dear, we?re not the fortunate ones
And girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun...

The phone rings, in the middle of the night,
My father yells ""What you gonna do with your life?""
Oh daddy dear, you know you're still number one,
But girls they wanna have fun,
Oh girls just wanna have

That?s all they really want...
Some fun...
When the working day is done
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna (girls) have fun (they want)
(Wanna have fun)
(Girls)
(Wanna have)


Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world
I wanna be the one to walk in the sun
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have

That's all they really want...
Is some fun...
When the working day is done
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have (girls) fun (they want)
(Wanna have fun)
(Girls)
(Wanna have)

They just wanna, they just wanna (girls)
They just wanna, they just wanna (Girls just wanna have fun)
Oh girls

Girls just wanna have fun
They just wanna, they just wanna,
They just wanna, they just wanna (Girls)
They just wanna, they just wanna (Girls just wanna have fun)
Girls, girls just wanna have fun


When the workin'
When the working day is done
Oh, when the working day is done
Oh, girls
Girls just wanna have fun

They just wanna, they just wanna (girls)
They just wanna, they just wanna (Girls just wanna have fun)
Oh, girls

Girls just wanna have fu-un

When the workin?,
When the working day is done, (They just wanna, they just wanna)
Oh, when the working day is done (Oh, girls)

Hair toss, check my nails
Baby how you feeling? (Feeling good as hell)

Woo child, tired of the bullshit
Go on dust your shoulders off, keep it moving
Yes, Lord, tryna get some new shit
In there, swimwear, going-to-the-pool shit
Come now, come dry your eyes
You know you a star, you can touch the sky
I know that it?s hard but you have to try
If you need advice, let me simplify

If he don't love you anymore
Just walk your fine ass out the door

I do my hair toss, check my nails
Baby how you feeling? (Feeling good as hell)
Hair toss, check my nails
Baby how you feeling? (Feeling good as hell)
Woo girl, need to kick off your shoes


Got to take a deep breath, time to focus on you
All the big fights, long nights that you been through
I got a bottle of tequila I been saving for you
Boss up and change your life
You can have it all, no sacrifice
I know he did you wrong, we can make it right
So go and let it all hang out tonight

?Cause he don't love you anymore

Playing in the street, gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on your face, you big disgrace
Kicking your can all over the place, singin'

We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

Buddy, you?re a young man, hard man
Shouting in the street, gonna take on the world someday
You got blood on your face, you big disgrace
Waving your banner all over the place


We will, we will rock you
Sing it out
We will, we will rock you

Buddy, you're an old man, poor man
Pleading with your eyes, gonna make you some peace someday
You got mud on your face, big disgrace
Somebody better put you back into your place

We will, we will rock you
Sing it
We will, we will rock you

When I feel heavy metal
Wooooo hooooooo
And I'm pins and I?m needles
Wooooo hooooooo


Well, I lie and I'm easy
All of the time, but I am never sure
Why I need you
Pleased to meet you

I got my head down
When I was young
It's not my problem
It?s not my problem

8;Remember the Name;Fort Minor;"You ready?

Let?s go!

Yeah!
For those of you that want to know what we're all about
It?s like this y'all, c'mon!

This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

Mike, he doesn?t need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard, whether it?s the beat or the mic
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him

But fuck 'em, he knows the code
It?s not about the salary, it's all about reality and makin? some noise
Makin' the story, makin? sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down Tak's pickin' it up, let?s go


Who the hell is he anyway? He never really talks much
Never concerned with status but still leavin? them starstruck
Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact
That many misjudge him because he makes a livin' from writin? raps

Put it together himself, now the picture connects
Never askin' for someone?s help, but to get some respect
He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
And now it all unfolds, the skill of an artist

This is twenty percent skill, eighty percent beer
Be a hundred percent clear ?cause Ryu is ill
Who would've thought he'd be the one to set the west in flames?
Then I heard him wreck it with The Crystal Method, Name of the Game

Came back dropped Megadef, took ?em to church
I like Bleach, man, Ryu had the stupidest verse
This dude is the truth, now everybody givin? him guest spots
His stock's through the roof I heard he fuckin? with S. Dot

This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name


They call him ""Ryu, The Sick"" and he's spittin? fire with Mike
Got him out the dryer, he's hot, found him in Fort Minor with Tak
What a fuckin? nihilist porcupine, he's a prick, he's a cock
The type women want to be with and rappers hope he gets shot

Eight years in the makin? patiently waitin? to blow
Now the record with Shinoda's takin? over the globe
He's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope
You won?t believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat

Tak, he?s not your everyday on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got, makin' his way to the top
He often gets a comment on his name, people keep asking him
""Was it given at birth or does it stand for an acronym?""

No, he?s livin? proof got him rockin' the booth
He?ll get you buzzin' quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they doin? give a hundred percent

Forget Mike, nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
It seems like he's never got time
Because he writes every note and he writes every line
And I?ve seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind

It's like a design is written in his head every time
Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
And those mother fuckers he runs with, those kids that he signed
Ridiculous, without even tryin', how do they do it?

This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

Yeah!

9;Can't Hold Us;Macklemore & Ryan Lewis;"Ay, ay, ay
Good to see you
Come on in, let?s go

Yeah, let's go, hahaha

Alright, alright, okay, uh
Alright, okay, alright, okay

Return of the Mack
Get ?em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet and checking a new hit me, get up

Thrift Shop, pimp strut walking
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope, nope, y'all can?t copy, yup

Bad, moonwalking, and this here is our party
My posse?s been on Broadway, and we did it our way, grown music
I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet I'm on

 

Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town

Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustlin?
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen with the four-track buzzing
Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crushin'

Labels out here, nah, they can?t tell me nothing
We give that to the people, spread it across the country
Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothing
We give it to the people, spread it across the country

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we?ll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can?t hold us

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we?ll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can?t hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I?m so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you


Y?all can't stop me
Go hard like I got an 808 in my heart beat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw

Tell me go up, gone
Deuces, goodbye, I?ve got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar?ll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now, sing that song, and it goes like

Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure gain humility, and now we keep marching, I said

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it?s over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can?t hold us

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it?s over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

And so we put our hands up

And so we put our hands up

Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oooh, let?s go
Na na na na na na na na
Heeeeey, and all my people say
Na na na na na na na na

Na na na na na na na na
Oooooh, and all my people say

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we?ll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can?t hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we?ll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can?t hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us";146
10;I Will Survive;Gloria Gaynor;"At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinkin? I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along

And so you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second you?d be back to bother me

Go on now, go walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren?t you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I?d crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?


Oh no not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I?ll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And I?ve got all my love to give
And I'll survive
I will survive
Hey, hey

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Kept tryin? hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high

And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free
But now I'm savin? all my lovin? for someone who's lovin? me

Go on now, go walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you?re not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I?d crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?


Oh no not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I?ve got all my life to live
I?ve got all my love to give
And I'll survive
I will survive
Oh

Go on now, go walk out the door
Just turn around now
?Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren?t you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I?d lay down and die?

Oh no not I, I will survive

But a slow glowing dream
That your fear seems to hide
Deep inside your mind
All alone I have cried
Silent tears full of pride
In a world made of steel
Made of stone

Feel the rhythm
Wrap around
Take a hold of my heart
What a feeling

I can have it all
Now I?m dancing for my life
Take your passion
And make it happen

You can dance right through your life

Close my eyes

13;Eye of the Tiger;Survivor;"Rising up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I?m back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive
So many times it happens too fast
You trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive

It?s the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger

Face to face, out in the heat
Hanging tough, staying hungry
They stack the odds ?til we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive


It?s the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he?s watching us all with the eye of the tiger

Rising up, straight to the top
Had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop
Just a man and his will to survive

It?s the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he?s watching us all with the eye of the tiger

The eye of the tiger

The eye of the tiger

19;Mama Said;Lukas Graham;"When Mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we were good kids
And Daddy told us, ""Never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun""
?Cause we were good kids

Remember asking both my mom and dad
Why we never traveled to exotic lands
We only ever really visit friends
Nothing to tell when the summer ends
We never really went buying clothes
Folks were passing on the stuff in plenty loads
New shoes once a year and then
Out to play ball so we could ruin them


When Mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we were good kids
And Daddy told us, ""Never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun""
'Cause we were good kids

Don?t get me wrong I didn't have it bad
I got enough loving from my mom and dad
But I don't think they really understood
When I said that I wanted the deal in Hollywood
I told them I?ll be singing on TV
The other kids were calling me a wannabe
The older kids, they started bugging me
But now they?re all standing right in front of me

When Mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we were good kids
And Daddy told us, ""Never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun""
'Cause we were good kids


I know which place I?m from
I know my home
When I'm in doubt and struggling
That?s where I go
An old friend can give advice
When new friends only know a half story
That's why I always keep ?em tight
And why I'm okay
I said I'm okay
You know what my mama said?
You know what she told me?

My Mama said that it was okay

21;Not Afraid;Eminem;"Yeah, It's been a ride...
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're trying to get out, just follow me
I'll get you there


You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take this thing out these words before I say 'em
Cause ain't no way I'm let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say 'em or do something I do it, I don't give a damn
What you think, I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if a thing's stopping me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
No if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shit'n
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shit's his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road

Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that fuck your fillings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehhhh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground


Relax, I ain't going back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack BLAOW
Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't
This fucking black cloud still follow's me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!

I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, Imma face my demons
I'm manning up, Imma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realise what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead
No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise
To focus only on handling my responsibility's as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazed and

I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road";81

30;I need A Doctor;Dr. Dre, Eminem, Skylar Grey;"I?m about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I?m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I?m sayin? that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day it?s just so grey and black


Hope, I just need a ray of that
'Cause no one sees my vision when I play it for ?em
They just say it's wack, but they don?t know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don?t see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fightin? you
It's dark, let me turn on the lights
And brighten me and enlighten you

I don?t think you realise what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue, 'cause me and you were like a crew
I was like your sidekick, you gon? either wanna fight
When I get off this fuckin' mic, or you gon? hug me
But I'm outta options, there's nothin? else I can do ?cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You?ve been gone for so long
I'm runnin? out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I?m puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin? lazy
Or you don?t believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form


Can't make a decision, you keep questionin? yourself
Second guessin' and it?s almost like you're beggin? for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin? be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin? you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin? label, let's tell the truth!
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I?m cryin' in this booth

You saved my life, now maybe it?s my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith
And you ain?t givin? up on me, get up, Dre!
I'm dyin?, I need you, come back for fuck's sake!

I?m about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I?m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
(I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life)

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don?t see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends! All I need is him

Fuckin? backstabbers!
When the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin? wrath of Aftermath, faggots!
You gon' see us in our lab jackets
And ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots!
And the cracker?s ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers, I?m back, bastards!
One more CD and then I'm packin' up my bags, and as
I?m leavin?, I'll guarantee they?ll scream
""Dre, don't leave us like that, man!"" ?cause

You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon

My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
And I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, he's so fucking gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn?t open up my own vault

My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me


As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece
Thinking

No one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I?m tripping off the powder

My, my, my, my
When the space between our bodies disappeared
My, my, my, my
Even through the pain, I can?t recall your face
Just the ache of knowing everything was gonna change
I got so close to love with you, my dear
But I don?t miss you
I miss the way you made me feel

I know
That the moment I chase is a race that I've already lost
But it?s long ago
And you were only afraid from fear of being alone
And I'm sure
That feeling, the ache is better than nothing at all

Feels like I lost part of me out there
My, my, my, my
When the space between our bodies disappeared
My, my, my, my
Even through the pain, I can?t recall your face
Just the ache of knowing everything was gonna change
I got so close to love with you, my dear
I don't miss you

""Can?t wake up happy everyday
Can't have the sun without the rain
Can?t have the moments where you're truly on top of the world
Without the moments where you're down in the dirt""

About anxiety, depression and the weight of the world

A little love, a little validation

I?m glad I found someone like you

Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fucking mind
Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose
Truth is, you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach, somewhere
Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor, again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in
[Chorus: Chester Bennington with Mike Shinoda]
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Go, stop the show
Choppy words and a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go
Mama, help me, I've been cursed
Death is rolling in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse
Can't contain him, he knows he works
Fuck, this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I won't be satisfied
So why try ignoring him?
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

[Verse 2]
I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day
[Verse 3]
I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

[Verse 4]
No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

[Verse 1]
I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I wanna see your face, painted black
Black as night, black as coal
I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

[Interlude]

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemies' eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead, long live the king""
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

[Interlude]

[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
And revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)
Aw, who would ever wanna be king?

[Chorus: MIKA, Both & Ariana Grande]
Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do is be true to you
That's all you ever need to know (That's all you ever need to know)

[Post-Chorus: MIKA & Ariana Grande]
So catch up 'cause you got an awful long way to go
So catch up 'cause you got an awful long way to go

[Bridge: Ariana Grande & MIKA]
That's all you ever need to know
You're only ever who you were (Oh, baby)
That's all you ever need to know (Oh, baby)
You're only ever who you were (Hey, hey)
That's all you ever need to know (Ooh-ooh)
That's all you ever need to know
[Chorus: MIKA, Ariana Grande & Both]
Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular (That's all you ever need to know)
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were (That's all you ever need to know)
Popular, I know about popular (That's all you ever need to know)
And all that you have to do is be true to you

87;Team;Lorde;"TranslationsItalianoPortuguêsTeam Lyrics[Intro]
Wait till you're announced
We've not yet lost all our graces
The hounds will stay in chains
Look upon Your Greatness and she'll
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
[Verse 1]
Call all the ladies out
They're in their finery
A hundred jewels on throats
A hundred jewels between teeth
Now bring my boys in
Their skin in craters like the moon
The moon we love like a brother
While he glows through the room

[Pre-Chorus]
Dancin' around the lies we tell
Dancin' around big eyes, as well
Even the comatose
They don't dance and tell

[Chorus]
We live in cities you'll never see on-screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team

[Post-Chorus]
I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
So there
You might also like[Verse 2]
So all the cups got broke
Shards beneath our feet
But it wasn't my fault
And everyone's competing
For a love they won't receive
'Cause what this palace wants is release

[Chorus]
We live in cities you'll never see on-screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team

[Post-Chorus]
I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
So there
I'm kind of older than I was when I reveled without a care
So there

[Chorus]
We live in cities you'll never see on-screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team
[Outro]
We're on each other's team
And you know, we're on each other's team
We're on each other's team
And you know, and you know, and you know330Embed";100

You know just what to say, things that scare me
I should just walk away, but I can't move my feet
The more that I know you, the more I want to

[Pre-Chorus]
Somethin' inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday, oh

[Chorus]
I didn't know that I was starvin' 'til I tasted you
Don't need no butterflies when you give me the whole damn zoo
By the way, right away, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starvin' 'til I tasted you
By the way, right away, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starvin' 'til I tasted you

You know just how to make my heart beat faster
Emotional earthquake, bring on disaster
You hit me head on, got me weak in my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, somethin' inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday, yeah
So much younger yesterday, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
I didn't know that I was starvin' 'til I tasted you

Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm fallin'
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself
[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm falling
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
In the sha-ha, sha-hallow
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
