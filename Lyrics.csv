Club Can't Handle Me;Flo Rida, David Guetta;"You know I know how

Stuntin', go wild can?t handle this player

Top like money, so the girls just melt
Want too many, all know me like Twelve
Look like cash and they all just stare
Bottles, models, standin' on chairs

Fall out ?cause that's the business
All out, it?s so ridiculous
Zone out so much attention
Scream out, ""I'm in the building""


They watchin', I know this
I?m rockin?, I'm rolling

Still feelin? myself, I?m like outta control
Can't stop now, more shots, let?s go
Ten more rounds, can I get a K.O.?
Paparazzi trying to make me pose
Came to party 'til I came no more
Celebrate ?cause that's all I know
Tip the groupies takin? off their clothes
Grand finale like Superbowl
Go hard, run the show
That's right, while I've got money to blow
More lights, more ice when I walk in the door
No hype, do it big all over the globe
I said it, go tell it
Confetti, who ready?
I?m ready, you ready
Let?s get it

Take you up out of the club and up in my new limo
Fly you all around the world

I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feelin? me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the

You break me down, and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive it came from

Third things third, send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you?ve heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin?
Inhibited, limited, 'til it broke open, and it rained down

Mama Said;Lukas Graham;"When Mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we were good kids
And Daddy told us, ""Never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun""
?Cause we were good kids

Remember asking both my mom and dad
Why we never traveled to exotic lands
We only ever really visit friends
Nothing to tell when the summer ends
We never really went buying clothes
Folks were passing on the stuff in plenty loads
New shoes once a year and then
Out to play ball so we could ruin them


When Mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we were good kids
And Daddy told us, ""Never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun""
'Cause we were good kids

Don?t get me wrong I didn't have it bad
I got enough loving from my mom and dad
But I don't think they really understood
When I said that I wanted the deal in Hollywood
I told them I?ll be singing on TV
The other kids were calling me a wannabe
The older kids, they started bugging me
But now they?re all standing right in front of me

When Mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we were good kids
And Daddy told us, ""Never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun""
'Cause we were good kids


I know which place I?m from
I know my home
When I'm in doubt and struggling
That?s where I go
An old friend can give advice
When new friends only know a half story
That's why I always keep ?em tight
And why I'm okay
I said I'm okay
You know what my mama said?
You know what she told me?

My Mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we were good kids
And Daddy told us, ""Never listen to the ones

2U;David Guetta, Justin Biber;"No limit in the sky
That I won?t fly for ya (for ya, for ya, for ya)
No amount of tears in my eyes
That I won't cry for ya (for ya), oh no
With every breath that I take
I want you to share that air with me
There?s no promise that I won't keep
I'll climb a mountain, there?s none too steep

When it comes to you
There?s no crime
Let's take both of our souls
And intertwine

When it comes to you
Don?t be blind
Watch me speak from my heart
When it comes to you
Comes to you
Want you to share that
(When it comes to you)


Cupid ain't a lie
Arrow got your name on it, oh yeah
Don?t miss out on a love
And regret yourself on it, oh (oh, oh)
Open up your mind, clear your head
Ain't gotta wake up to an empty bed
Share my life, it?s yours to keep
Now that I give to you all of me, oh

When it comes to you
There's no crime
Let's take both of our souls

Not Afraid;Eminem;"Yeah, It's been a ride...
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're trying to get out, just follow me
I'll get you there


You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take this thing out these words before I say 'em
Cause ain't no way I'm let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say 'em or do something I do it, I don't give a damn
What you think, I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if a thing's stopping me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
No if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shit'n
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shit's his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road

Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that fuck your fillings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehhhh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground


Relax, I ain't going back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack BLAOW
Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't
This fucking black cloud still follow's me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!

I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, Imma face my demons
I'm manning up, Imma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realise what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead
No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise
To focus only on handling my responsibility's as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazed and

I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road";81;3;0;3;2;0;spotify:track:7Ie9W94M7OjPoZVV216Xus

I need A Doctor;Dr. Dre, Eminem, Skylar Grey;"I?m about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I?m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I?m sayin? that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day it?s just so grey and black


Hope, I just need a ray of that
'Cause no one sees my vision when I play it for ?em
They just say it's wack, but they don?t know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don?t see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fightin? you
It's dark, let me turn on the lights
And brighten me and enlighten you

I don?t think you realise what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue, 'cause me and you were like a crew
I was like your sidekick, you gon? either wanna fight
When I get off this fuckin' mic, or you gon? hug me
But I'm outta options, there's nothin? else I can do ?cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You?ve been gone for so long
I'm runnin? out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I?m puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin? lazy
Or you don?t believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form


Can't make a decision, you keep questionin? yourself
Second guessin' and it?s almost like you're beggin? for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin? be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin? you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin? label, let's tell the truth!
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I?m cryin' in this booth

You saved my life, now maybe it?s my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith
And you ain?t givin? up on me, get up, Dre!
I'm dyin?, I need you, come back for fuck's sake!

I?m about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I?m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
(I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life)

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don?t see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends! All I need is him

Fuckin? backstabbers!
When the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin? wrath of Aftermath, faggots!
You gon' see us in our lab jackets
And ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots!
And the cracker?s ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers, I?m back, bastards!
One more CD and then I'm packin' up my bags, and as
I?m leavin?, I'll guarantee they?ll scream
""Dre, don't leave us like that, man!"" ?cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You?ve been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time

The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I?m tripping off the power

The system broken, the school is closed, the prison's open

With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I?ll see you in the morning

Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically they can kiss my asshole
I?m an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon

My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
And I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, he's so fucking gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn?t open up my own vault

My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me


As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece
Thinking

No one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I?m tripping off the powder

This Love;Maroon 5;"I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again but always in my heart, oh

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breakin? in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won?t say goodbye anymore

Whoa
Whoa
Whoa

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied, oh
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again, but uh-oh


This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won?t say goodbye anymore

Whoa
Whoa
Whoa

I?ll fix these broken things, repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's all right (it?s all right, it's all right)
My pressure on your hips, I?m sinking my fingertips
Every inch of you
'Cause I know that?s what you want me to do

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won?t say goodbye anymore

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breakin? in front of me

An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I go down to the grave and die happily
Leave the body and my soul to be a part of thee

She runs through the rain in the middle of the night
Say what, no, why?
Well, she really wants to take you with her
If you give her just a spoon of love
All of a sudden she got called from above, oh-oh
She just left a note, right next to my coat
You saw her tears cried
I'm just up in my mind, oh, up in my mind
Where everything's right
She's just up in her, up in her mind

She got too high in her mind
She never gets back just in time
She wants to know
If she's alive or dreams of reality (mind)

Part of Me;Noah Kahan;"I think I forgot the things I?ve done
It's just good to be alive
And I could stand great before the sun
Though it?s getting in my eyes
And how was Salt Lake City, dear?
Do you feel me?

'Cause now you let your heart get filled
With someone else's love
And now you let your head get held
In someone else?s arms
And if I die tomorrow, babe, would you feel me?
Feel me?

?Cause you were only a little bit of light
And you were only a minute of my time
I don't miss you
I miss the way you made me feel

Like I lost part of me out there
My, my, my, my
When the space between our bodies disappeared
My, my, my, my
Even through the pain, I can?t recall your face
Just the ache of knowing everything was gonna change
I got so close to love with you, my dear
But I don't miss you
I miss the way you made me feel

And there was something in the air
As we drove your parents? car
Fire we both knew was there
But couldn't bring ourselves to start
I scream the words inside your head
And hoped you?d feel me
Feel me

'Cause you were only a little bit of light
You were only a minute of my time

But I don?t miss you
I miss the way you made me feel

I know
That the moment I chase is a race that I've already lost
But it?s long ago
And you were only afraid from fear of being alone
And I'm sure
That feeling, the ache is better than nothing at all

Feels like I lost part of me out there
My, my, my, my
When the space between our bodies disappeared

""Can?t wake up happy everyday

Can?t have the moments where you're truly on top of the world
Without the moments where you're down in the dirt""

About anxiety, depression and the weight of the world

A little love, a little validation

Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fucking mind
Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose
Truth is, you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach, somewhere
Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor, again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in
[Chorus: Chester Bennington with Mike Shinoda]
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

Go, stop the show
Choppy words and a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go
Mama, help me, I've been cursed
Death is rolling in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse
Can't contain him, he knows he works
Fuck, this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I won't be satisfied
So why try ignoring him?
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out

Am I more than you bargained for yet?
I've been dying to tell you
Anything you want to hear
'Cause that's just who I am this week
Lie in the grass next to the mausoleum
I'm just a notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song

And break a name
We're always sleeping in and sleeping

And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

Is this more than you bargained for yet?
Oh, don't mind me, I'm watching
You two from the closet
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
Isn't it messed up how I'm just dying to be him?

I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

[Verse 2]
I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day
[Verse 3]
I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

[Verse 4]
No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

[Verse 1]
I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky

If the curve of you was curved on me
I'd tell you that I loved you

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

[Interlude]

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemies' eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead, long live the king""
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

[Interlude]

[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
And revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)
Aw, who would ever wanna be king?

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield

Searching for a message in that fear and pain

Digging through the wreckage of your disregard

Dunk me in the toilets, now it's you that cleans them
You tried to make me feel bad with the things you do
It ain't so funny when the joke's on you
Ooh, the joke's on you
Got everyone laughin', got everyone clappin', askin'

You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

[Chorus]
Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you?out?there?standing
Crestfallen on the?landing

My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it

You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

[Chorus]
Dom Pérignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems
[Bridge]
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
""This dorm was once a madhouse""
I made a joke, ""Well, it's made for me""
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
""She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

Welcome
Welcome to The E.N.D
Do not panic, there is nothing to fear
Everything around you is changing
Nothing stays the same
This version of myself is not permanent
Tomorrow, I will be different
The energy never dies
Energy cannot be destroyed, or created
It always is, and it always will be
This is the end, and the beginning..
Forever infinite

You know I dream in color
And do the things I want (Do the things I want)

[Pre-Chorus]
You think you got the best of me
Think you've had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'll come running back
Baby, you don't know me, 'cause you're dead wrong

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself, and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

[Verse 2]
You heard that I was starting over with someone new
They told you I was moving on and over you

You didn't think that I'd come back
I'd come back swinging
You tried to break me, but you see

Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo
[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and
[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

[Verse 2]
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

Fighter;Christina Aguilera;"Fighter Lyrics[Intro]
Hm
After all you put me through
You'd think I'd despise you (Ooh)
But in the end, I wanna thank you
'Cause you made me that much stronger

[Verse 1]
Well, I, I thought I knew you
Thinkin' that you were true
Guess I, I couldn't trust, called your bluff
Time is up 'cause I've had enough
You were there by my side
Always down for the ride
But your joy ride just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out in shame, mhm
[Pre-Chorus]
After all of the stealing and cheating
You probably think that I hold resentment for you
But uh-uh, oh no, you're wrong
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do
I wouldn't know just how capable
I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you, 'cause it

[Chorus]
Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah, ohh

[Verse 2]
Never saw it coming
All of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in on a good thing
Before I realized your game
I heard you're goin' 'round
Playin' the victim now
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
After all of the fights and the lies
Guess you're wanting to hold me
But that won't work anymore (No more, a-ha, it's over)
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down
So I wanna say thank you, 'cause it

[Chorus]
Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

[Bridge]
How could this man I thought I knew
Turn out to be unjust, so cruel?
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to see the truth
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself
Through living in denial
But in the end you'll see, you won't stop me
I am a fighter and I (I'm a fighter)
I ain't gon' stop (I ain't gonna stop)
There is no turning back
I've had enough
[Chorus]
Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder (Yeah)
It makes me that much wiser (Oh yeah)
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster (Yeah)
Made my skin a little bit thicker (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Makes me that much smarter (Yeah)
So thanks for making me a fighter (Fighter)

[Interlude]
You thought I would forget, but I, I remembered (Ooh)
'Cause I remembered (Ooh)
I remembered
You thought I would forget (Ooh-ooh)
I remembered (Oh-ooh)
'Cause I remembered (Oh)
I remembered

[Chorus]
Makes me that much stronger (Ooh-ooh)
Makes me work a little bit harder (Ooh-ooh)
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter20Embed";189;0;0;1;0;1;spotify:track:6dp3XPQJuC7qP7TaEFVgL5
It's My Life;Bon Jovi;"TranslationsPortuguês????????Its My Life Lyrics[Verse 1]
This ain't a song for the broken-hearted (woah oh, woah oh, oh)
No silent prayer for the faith-departed
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud

[Chorus]
It's my life, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, ""I did it my way""
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
[Verse 2]
This is for the ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down
Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky, got to make your own breaks

[Chorus]
It's my life, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, ""I did it my way""
I just wanna live while I'm alive
'Cause it's my life

[Bridge]
Better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down

[Chorus]
It's my life, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, ""I did it my way""
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
And it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever

Beatiful Day;U2;"TranslationsPortuguêsBeautiful Day Lyrics[Verse 1]
The heart is a bloom, shoots up through the stony ground
There's no room, no space to rent in this town
You're out of luck, and the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck, and you're not moving anywhere
You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day
Sky falls, you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
[Verse 2]
You're on the road, but you've got no destination
You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over, and it's been all over you

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Ooh-hoo-hoo

[Post-Chorus]
Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

[Bridge]
See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out

Party in the U.S.A.;Miley Cyrus;"Translations??????PortuguêsParty in the U.S.A. Lyrics[Verse 1]
I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess (Woah)
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

[Pre-Chorus]
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a JAY-Z song was on
And a JAY-Z song was on
And a JAY-Z song was on
[Chorus]
So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, ""Yeah""
Movin' my hips like, ""Yeah""
Got my hands up, they're playing my song
I know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. 
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. 

[Verse 2]
Get to the club in my taxi cab
Everybody's lookin' at me now
Like, ""Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?
She gotta be from out of town""
So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo

[Pre-Chorus]
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
And a Britney song was on

Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know? I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know ?I was lost

I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game? made for everyone
And love is the prize

So wake me up when it's all over

Drinking fast and then we talk slow

And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

T.I.P. (Yo, uh)
Ay Jamie, JT (Oh)
I'm 'bout to get back hot again man
You know I'm fresh out that thang, let go
You know you lookin at a winner, winner, winner
I'm so up there and so out there, you so not here
Hey, hey, you see we so up there and we so out there
Uh, yeah, let me get it right here first. Hey!

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
I'm wakin', up in the morning
Hustlin' to the stage, if I've been performin'
Bustlin' through the hay and bustin' the door in
Lately nothin' messes up my step and scorin'
And speakin' of the Misses, I'm watchin' 'em pour in (Uh)
Just like a drink that I'm enjoyin'
And don't mean bottles, you welcome to join in
Just look at me soarin', feelin' like Jordan
[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
(Aaah-ah) Hold up I ain't finished yet
On the top but you just don't get it yet
I don't get cut, I make 'em cut the check
Can't hear me in the stands, let me say it again
(Aaah-ah) You ain't heard I'm the shit
On the top but you just don't get it yet
I never got cut but I make 'em cut the check
So hate on but guess what

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Jamie Foxx]
I feel like I can't miss
I know they want me to fall
But ain't nothin bigger than this
So just pass me the ball
You know you lookin at a winner, winner, winner
I can't miss, can't lose, can't miss
You know you lookin at winner, winner, winner
`Cause I'm a winner, yeah I'm a winner

[Verse 2: Jamie Foxx]
I'm steppin' out in the evening
Keep winnin' and screamin'
You gotta be cheatin' but I'm so breezy
I make this look easy
And y'all thinkin' I'm seasoned, you gotta believe me
I went from TVs to screens to DVDs
To CDs to MP3s overseas
I got, no time, the talking is boring
Just look at me soarin', feeling like Jordan

[Verse 3: T.I.]
That's right, you see the, Porsche Panamera, got 'em in hysteria
The turbo super fast and that McLaren even scarier
Hear me turnin' corners, burnin' rubber in your area
I'm hard to follow once I pop the clutch and hit the throttle
I'm recession proof, I don't run to money, money run to me
In this economy, guess I'm considered an anomaly
Bugattis, Maseratis, new Ferraris, I got one of each
My future bright, tight like the pussy out in front of me
Turn pain to progression in every studio session
Passion into perfection, to failure I'm an exception
Fuck if you wanna lose, to battle me is a blessing
You couldn't die at the hands of a better man
I ran from the bottom to the best, no Auto-Tune
Been in the lead, say you seen King follow whom
Never that, I'm the freshest go ask whoever that
King back, money long as a old Cadillac

Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.);Katy Perry;"TranslationsPortuguês????????Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.) Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
This a hickey or a bruise?

[Pre-Chorus]
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn
[Chorus]
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh-woah

[Post-Chorus]
But this Friday night
Do it all again
But this Friday night
Do it all again

[Verse 2]
Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

Firework;Katy Perry;"TranslationsPortuguêsFirework Lyrics[Verse 1]
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Awe, awe, awe""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Awe, awe, awe""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

[Verse 2]
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

Roar;Katy Perry;"TranslationsPortuguês????????FrançaisRoar Lyrics[Verse 1]
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion

Let's take a journey

I know a place where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (Undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryna creep a little sneak peek (At us)

Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle

I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (Keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own (Ooh)

And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)

Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me

So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day havin' your kids

I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that

[Verse 4]
Now that it's over, stop callin' me
Come pick up your clothes

We at war with terrorism, racism
But most of all we at war with ourselves

[Chorus]
(Jesus, walk)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus, walk with me)
[Verse 1]
You know what the Midwest is? Young and restless
Where restless (Niggas) might snatch your necklace
And next these (Niggas) might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these (Niggas) who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is
Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless *gasps*
Try to catch it *gasps* it's kinda hard
Getting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method
They be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us
Sayin' ""We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast""
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis
My mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well mama I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move
I hope
[Chorus]
(Jesus, walk)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus, walk with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus, walk)
And I don't think there's nothin' I can do now to right my wrongs

I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid 'cause we ain't spoke in so long

To the victims of welfare feel we livin' in Hell here, hell yeah

Now, hear ye, hear ye, want to see Thee more clearly
I know He hear me when my feet get weary
'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models: we rap, we don't think
I ain't here to argue about His facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single, dawg, radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?
Well if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' about
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out

Man, at least a dude with a car!
So, first of all, we gonna work on the stomach
Nobody wants a little tight ass

One, and two, and three, and four, and get them sit ups right, and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head, stop, breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son, don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh, she's so excited
Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and my dick
(Ah!) What's scary to me is
Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came, I came, I came
[Chorus]
It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me

Unless she's talking about freaking out
Then maybe we can work it out
Work it out, work it out
Work it out, work it out now

[Verse 2]
Ooh, girl, your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set, Twista said ""Get It Wet""
Ooh girl your breath is harsh!

Off them tracks yea I bought them cars
Still, kill a nigga on 16 bars
We ain't sweating to the oldies, we juking to a cold beat
Maybe one day girl we can bone

Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop

Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan

Any pessimists, I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line: ""Dawg, in due time!""
Now he look at me, like, ""Damn, dawg! You where I am!""

Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop

Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was havin' nervous breakdowns
Like ""Man, these niggas that much better than me?""
Baby, I'm goin' on an aeroplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different

The good life, let's go on a living spree
Shit, they say the best things in life are free
The good life, it feel like Atlanta
It feel like L.A., it feel like Miami
It feel like NY, summertime Chi
Ah! (Now throw yo' hands up in the sky)
So I roll through good
Y'all pop the trunk, I pop the hood, Ferrari
And she got the goods
And she got that ass, I got to look, sorry!

[Bridge]
Yo, it's got to be 'cause I'm seasoned
Haters give me them salty looks, Lawry's
50 told me, ""Go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up""
The good life

[Chorus: Kanye West & T-Pain]
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine

Have you ever popped champagne on a plane, while gettin' some brain?
Whipped it out, she said, ""I never seen Snakes on a Plane""
Whether you broke or rich, you gotta get this
Havin' money's not everything, not havin' it is
I was splurgin' on Tryst, but when I get my card back
Activated, I'm back to Vegas (Welcome the good life)
'Cause I always had a passion for flashin'
Befo' I had it, I closed my eyes and imagined the good life

[Outro: T-Pain]
Ayy, it's the good life, better than the life I lived
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmama
Ain't the only girl callin' me ""Baby""

99 Problems;Jay-Z;"Translations???????99 Problems Lyrics[Produced by Rick Rubin]
[Chorus]
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
[Verse 1]
I've got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's Money, Cash, Hoes
I'm from the hood, stupid! What type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough
I'm like, ""Fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole!
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward.""
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads
Fuckers, I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas, I ain't dumb
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one  hit me!
[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one  hit me!
[Verse 2]
The year is '94, in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin' law
Got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
I heard, ""Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?""
Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low?
Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more?
""Well, you was doing 55 in a 54
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are.""
I ain't steppin' out of shit, all my paper's legit
""Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?""
Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
""Aren't you sharp as a tack?
You some type of lawyer or something?
Somebody important or something?""
Well, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
""Well, we'll see how smart you are when the K9 come!""
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one  hit me!

If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son

[Verse 3]
Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of havin' a pussy
But a pussy havin' no goddamn sense, try and push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clappin'
And he and his boys gonna be yappin' to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratchin' again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' em
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mil' for bail cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassin' them
Tryin' to play the boy like he's saccharine
But ain't nothin' sweet 'bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems, bein' a bitch ain't one  hit me!
[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son

So we gonna dance until we drop, drop

All we got, all we got, all we got, all we got
All we got, all we got, all we got, all we got
Glad that you made it, look around
You don't see one person sitting down
They got drinks in their hands
And the rooms a bust
At the end of the night maybe you'll find love
Fake chit chat bout the things they got
And my scout reputation keeping it hot girl
At the party of the year I'm a master plan
If you make me realize I'm your man

If the people get lost, underneath the moonlight
Hotsy-totsy, paparazzi, hold it while I take this flick
Speak easy, rocking the feathers I'm breezy
Hope you can keep up boys, cause believe me, I'm the bee's knees

It don't mean a thing if I give you my heart
If you tear it apart, no, ah, ah, ah, oh
It don't mean a thing if I ain't in your eyes
Papa that ain't gonna fly, no, ah, ah, ah, oh
It don't mean a thing if I give you my heart

Worst
Motherfucker never loved us
Fucker never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now
Still at it, scrub Js with a toothbrush
Shit, niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police askin' us questions
Nigga, we don't know shit
Flexin'nigga, I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us
Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you and look at you
Aww, I'm glad that they chose us
'Cause, man, it's a mission
Tryna fight to the finish just to see, am I finished?
[Chorus]
On my worst behavior, no?
They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Motherfucker never loved us
Remember? Motherfucker
Remember? Motherfucker never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior
Don't you ever get it fucked up
Motherfuckers never loved us
Man, motherfuckers never loved us

Hold up, hold my phone
Motherfuckers never loved us
Fucker never loved us
Now you want to roll one
Motherfucker never loved us
So everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Motherfucker, I done growed up
You know me? You know me?
I'm liable to do anything when it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me

[Verse 3]
Who's hot, who not?
Tell me, who rock, who sell out in stores?
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop
Whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothin' changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
Then it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man, it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you, bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the borderline
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior
[Outro]
Remember?

Remember?
Hold up, hold my phone
They used to never want to hear us

Gotta do what I gotta do
Yeah
Uh

[Verse 1: Drake]
All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told 'em don't even plate it
And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only ""hello"" or a ""happy belated""
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after, texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer?
I learned workin' with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fuckin' with ya, damn
Is it the fall? Time for me to revisit the past
There's women to call, there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all, damn
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like
[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fuck your girl, is it true?
You gettin' money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?

And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, so much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill, she started confessin'
And started undressin' and asked me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure, damn
She say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom, confusing me with questions like

Moment 4 Life;Nicki Minaj, Drake;"TranslationsPortuguêsMoment 4 Life Lyrics[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I fly with the stars in the skies
I am no longer trying to survive
I believe that life is a prize
But to live doesn't mean you're alive
Don't worry 'bout me and who I fire
I get what I desire, it's my empire
And yes, I call the shots, I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water upon a vampire
In this very moment, I'm king
In this very moment, I slay Goliath with a sling
This very moment, I bring
Put it on everything that I will retire with the ring
And I will retire with the crown, yes
No, I'm not lucky, I'm blessed, yes
Clap for the heavyweight champ, me
But I couldn't do it all alone, we
Young Money raised me, grew up out in Baisley
Southside Jamaica, Queens, and it's crazy
'Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me
Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't faze me
Ain't being cocky, we just vindicated
Best believe that when we done, this moment will be syndicated
I don't know, this night just remind me of
Everything they deprived me of (Yeah)
Put your drinks up
It's a celebration every time we link up
We done did everything they can think of
Greatness is what we on the brink of
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive

Shout out to the OVO, red wings and fatigues, oh

Fuck it, me and Nicki Nick gettin' married today
And all you bitches that be hatin' can catch a bouquet, ooh

Fan mail from twenty-seven million (Young!)
And I want it all
It's gonna take more than that, hope that ain't all you got
I need it all (Hold up!)
The money, the fame, the cars, the clothes
I can't just let you run up on me like that
All on me like that, yeah
I see you aiming at my pedestal
So I think I gotta let you know

[Verse 3: Jeezy]
It's go hard or go home, back to your residence
Soon the Red Dogs give the block back to the presidents
I used to run my whole block like Obama them
You ain't gotta believe me, go ask my momma them
Couldn't even come in my room, smelled like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playing casino
Count the style I keep in my bag, they can't afford it
Tell 'em ""Give me back my swag,"" they tryna clone it
See my Louis chucks, Louis flag, Louis frames
Louis belt, what that make me, Louis Mane?
I'm in the all-white party wearing all black
With my new black watch, call it the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, Carti'ac a wrist
Yeah, they say they hard, they ain't hard as this
Hard: the one word describes me
If I wasn't doing this, you know where I'd be to 'em

We found Love;Rihanna, Calvin Harris;"TranslationsPortuguêsEnglishFrançaisWe Found Love Lyrics[Video Intro: Agyness Deyn]
It's like you're screaming, and no one can hear
You almost feel ashamed, that someone could be that important
That without them, you feel like nothing
No one will ever understand how much it hurts
You feel hopeless, like nothing can save you
And when it's over and it's gone
You almost wish you could have all that bad stuff back
So that you could have the good

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive
[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Shine a light through an open door
Love and life, I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

But I've gotta let it go

Nowhere to hide when I'm gettin' you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine (Just imagine, just imagine)

When you dance, dance, dance
A feelin' good, good, creepin' up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on

Buckle your seatbelt, it's time for takeoff

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're looking at me for the pay cut
But homicide be looking at you from the face down
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reaping everything I sow, so my karma coming heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I've gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say

My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
What you want you, a house?? You, a car?
Forty acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Digging in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico, ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, every day I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all
Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God
[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Thundercat]
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid of a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers

[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me

Nobody pray for me
It been that day for me
Way (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact, I'm downin' this
DUSSÉ with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
AM to the PM, PM to the AM, funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

I am a sinner
Who's prob'ly gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me, Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away, I got

Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life, I always
Knew life can be dangerous, I can say that I like a challenge
And you tell me it's painless, you don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hangin' witcha?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar, another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick, I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every makin' of his? Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge, even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I can feel the changes, I can feel the new people round me
Just wanna be famous, you can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me, that's amazin'
To you, that's a quick check, with all disrespect, let me say this
[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise, Kendrick Lamar]

On two different axles, you live in a world, you livin' behind

This shit is vital, I know you had to, this shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain is way more believable
Give me a feasible gain, rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know
This is somethin' you can blame on yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box

I got, I got, I got, I got
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain, and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle, though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got
Realness, I just kill shit cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, thats him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldiers DNA (Im a soldier's DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didnt have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like Im supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say
[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & Geraldo Rivera]
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages
[Verse 2]
Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murderthese are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murderour DNA

What's wrong with the world, Mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryna stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all
[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurtin', hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?

[Verse 2: Taboo]
It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong
With this world that we livin' in? People keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the truth, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?

Most of us only care about money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria

Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity? (Yeah)
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality? (Yeah)

Why does emotion gotta move so fast?
Love is progress if you could make it last
Why is it that you just lose control
Every time you agree on takin' it slow?
So why has it got to be so damn tough?
'Cause fools in lust could never get enough
Of love; showin' him the love that you be givin'
Changin' up your livin' for a lovin' transition (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl, it's a mission tryin' to get you to listen
Screamin' at each other has become our tradition
You yell, I yell, everybody yells
Got neighbors across the street sayin', ""Who the hell?!""
Who the hell? What the hell's goin' down?
Too much of the bickering, kill it with the sound and

Why? 'Cause it's the same old routine

Now that I escape, sleepwalk awake (Yeah)
Those who could relate know the world ain't cake
Jail bars ain't golden gates, those who fake, they break
When they meet their four hundred-pound mate
If I could rule the world (If I ruled the world), everyone would have a gun
In the ghetto. of course, when giddy-upping on their horse
I kick a rhyme drinking moonshine
I pour a sip on the concrete for the deceased
But, no, don't weep, Wyclef's in a state of sleep
Thinking 'bout the robbery that I did last week
Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
I want to play with pelicans from here to Baghdad
Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit
My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist
I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends
A born again hooligan only to be king again

I play my enemies like a game of chess
Where I rest, no stress if you don't smoke sess
Lest I must confess, my destiny's manifest
In some Gore-Tex and sweats, I make treks like I'm homeless
Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess
Capture your bounty like Eliot Ness, yes
Bless you if you represent the Fu
But I'll hex you with some witch's brew if you're doo-doo
Voodoo, I can do what you do, easy
Believe me, fronting niggas give me heebie-jeebies (Ha)
So while you imitating Al Capone
I'll be Nina Simone and defecating on your microphone

So, what, am I not 'sposed to have an opinion?
Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman?
Call me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled
When a female fires back
Suddenly big talker don't know how to act
So he does what any little boy would do
Makin' up a few false rumors or two
That for sure is not a man to me
Slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy (It's so sad)
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say
[Chorus: Christina Aguilera]

Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'?
Call me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing
If you look back in history
It's a common double standard of society
The guy gets all the glory, the more he can score
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore
I don't understand why it's okay
The guy can get away with it, the girl gets named

La-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 1: Pressure & Eamon]
Sometimes I
Don't see it so clear when everything I need
And know's right beneath my nose here, sometimes I
Know that this showbiz will make me blow, I let go, eyes closed and I don't steer
Let the rollercoaster take me, going close to crazy
Maybe I should call it if it's all a broken daydream
Like peace and solidity, please, are you kidding me?
What, me quit and give up all the free shit I didn't need?
I'm grateful to say it gave me a stage
Maybe I was made for more than slavin' cradle to grave
Without a space to escape would of wasted away
Chasing a ray of sunshine upon the rainiest day (Oh, yeah)
A smarter man would quit this while he's sane, been addicted
To the pain of living in the game for so long
Like every bar I wrote formed a cage, if I could
Walk away I'd already be gone (Oh, woo-ooh-ooh)
[Chorus: Eamon]
What, and quit show business?
What kind of low is this?
They say do what you love and you'll never work a day or a night
Feel like I've been working my whole life
What, and quit show business?
What kind of low is this?
They say do what you love and you'll never work a day or a night
Feel like I've been working my whole life, and the horns go

[Post-Chorus: Eamon]

[Verse 2: Suffa & Eamon]
Youll never hear me
Complain so dont get me wrong, I
Love what I do, I do, I do, twenty years and
Some change though, been here so long
Im married to the game, I do, I do (So whats up then?)
Well, nowadays fans have too much access
To the point, I had a man come to my address
To the point, I hid a bat under my mattress
To the point, I had to lance this rancid abscess
This business is tied to our phones
And this just keeps us tied to our phone
And Im tired of my phone so Im retiring my phone
And all the sickness that resides in my phone, look
(Woah-woah-oh-oh)
Dont get me wrong, son, I love to connect
(Woah-woah-oh-oh)
But I just wanna write songs, they wanna come for my neck
(Woah-woah-oh-oh)
And I got a young family I gotta protect
(Woah-woah-ooh)
So I'ma disconnect, love and respect

Is all I've known my whole life

Spent a week writing an apology I'll never send, oh-oh
Picked the clothes I would wear if you'd ever see me again

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll end up leaving the party alone
All my friends will keep asking if something's wrong
And they've heard all our history and know my regrets
But they don't know you're stuck inside my head

[Chorus]
And I'll see you in my dreams tonight, oh-oh
And I'll wake up, think I've made it right
Felt so real, swear it was you
But then again, I always do
So I'll be alright
When I see you in my dreams tonight, oh

Meet me there, you know where, sam? as every night befor?, oh-oh
Drink the wine every time 'til we're kissing on the floor

[Pre-Chorus]
And I say all the things I've been wanting to say
And you laugh like you weren't even mad anyway
Then I hear my alarm and I'm back in this place
But just for you, I'll make it through the day

[Chorus]
And I'll see you in my dreams tonight, oh-oh

The city sleeps, but I'm awake
You left without saying anything
Said ""I do"", I guess you?don't
You?were never ready
Dancing?tipsy in the street
We were living?like a movie scene
Then you go and dropped the diamond ring
Said it got too heavy

Hide nor seek
There's a haunting melody
Singing oh, oh, oh
Where're you gonna go
Cold, cold, cold feet

Wherever you are I wish you well
Sunday morning's gonna hurt like hell
Angels singing wedding bells
They're not ringing for me
I couldn't do a thing to make you stay
Miss Julia Roberts, don't you run away
Now all that I'm left with here today
Is one hell of a story

Who's gonna chase your wild horses?
Who's gonna give you love?
Who's gonna chase you, who's gonna chase ya?

Don't come any closer
I've seen how this all works
So when you tell me lies
Look me in the eyes first
I'm just trying to protect my heart
Showed you every single scar
Say, ""It's you, not me""
'Cause that's my favorite part

Why does it hurt so much?
With every single touch, we thought this was love
Why do I want to stay numb?
I want to be alone, I just don't know how
Why does it hurt so much?

Why do I want to stay numb? (Numb, numb, numb)

If I'm never lonely, I won't ever feel the pain
Love me in the morning anyways, anyways
Love me in the morning anyways
If I'm never lonely, I won't ever feel the pain
Love me in the morning anyways, anyways

[Verse 2]
I saw it in your eyes
Baby blue, like the sky
And all these puzzled games you played
Fucking with my mind, you would never stay (Never stay)
I saw it coming soon
'Cause when you looked at me she would look at you
Say, ""It's you, not me""
'Cause that's my favorite part

When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check

I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand?
That I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check

Overpass Graffiti;Ed Sheeran;"TranslationsEspañolPortuguêsDeutsch?????Overpass Graffiti Lyrics[Verse 1]
This is a dark parade
Another rough patch to rain on
To rain on
I know your friends may say
This is a cause for celebration
Hip, hip, hooray, love

[Pre-Chorus]
Photographs in sepia tones
So still, the fire's barely fighting the cold
Alone
There are times when I can feel your ghost
Just when I'm almost letting you go
The cards were stacked against us both
[Chorus]
I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full-stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me

[Verse 2]
This is a goddamn shame
I never wanted to break it
Leave us tainted
Know I should walk away
But I just can't replace us
Or even erase us

[Pre-Chorus]
The car was stuck, the engine stalled
And both of us got caught out in the snow
Alone
There were times when I forget the lows
And think the highs were all that we'd ever known
The cards were stacked against us both

[Chorus]
I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full-stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me

But I'll remember the way we were

Baby, you will never be lost on me

set fire to another love;rare skeletons;"Cold Blooded Lyrics(Hook)
Ya runnin but ya cant hide
Strugglin tryna stay alive
People plottin on ya gravesite
So watch out for the snake eyes
They so cold blooded (2x)
Yeah..

(Verse 1)
I done met all types of people
Good and evil
Been amongst all walks of life
Some that you be perceive to be decent
Will soon deceive you
Cus who they really are inside
Aint who you thought they were
At the bar we worked at was full of skeletons in the closet door
I knew a couple named Steve and Rose whove been known to slow base
Let me start the story off with her
She was an alcoholic, but so was he
Socially they were both popular
So in love, it was rare to see him and her not there
Words cant explain how shocked I was
And then when Steve walked in with his blood shot eyes
Cryin, I could tell that hed been up all night
Told us that Rose had overdosed commited suicide
And the woman that he loved just died.  Not Rose!
People sittin at the bar froze
Made a toast to him, may she rest in peace
With his head in his chest, Steve wept with grief
He got drunk, went to get some sleep
Its sick cus after he left rumors started to fly
Someone said Lady hes sketchy Steve, been seen numerous times
With another girl he screwed on the side
Now all of sudden she was dead it seemed little odd (odd)
Was it crocodile tears he was cryin? Was it all a façade?
She could drink, was it really a bottle of pills and some vodka that caused her demise?
A lot of the guys started callin him a murderer
And I aint really tryin to accuse him but
He was kissin on his new girlfriend at the bar same night of my funeral
Cus shes so cold blooded
(Hook)
Ya runnin but ya cant hide
Strugglin tryna stay alive
People plottin on ya gravesite
So watch out for the snake eyes
They so cold blooded (2x)

(Bridge)
The ones that you trust are the ones in disguise
Thought you was loved but then gonna find out your despised
Snakes that were hiding they strike
They so cold blooded..

(Verse 2)
I knew a couple named Ike and Linda
Same bar, different story
Let me think where should I begin?
I wish this was a fiction piece
But I witnessed this shit time and time again
Ya see, Ike was the quiet type who shot darts with his best friend Mark
But he liked a pinch
Of cocaine and raw but none of us woulda thought his life would come
To a violent end
Until one day the bar got silent then
You could hear pin drop the minute that Lyn walked in
Cryin, cus she said Ike died someone tied him up and then they set him on fire, damn!
They found his body right inside of the complex
Whoever did it mustve had an accomplice
But the cops just said it was drug deal gone bad
Tried to blame it on the drug problems
What I found bizarre was
They found an empty gas can in the storage compartment
That had Lyns palm prints
But it was her and Ikes place so
It wasnt enough to implicate her involvement
Case unsolved and two weeks later it would raise an eyebrow
But they burying him
Everybody at the bar found out that Ikes friend Mark got married to Lyn
Cold blooded bitch!

Fast Car;Jonas Blue, Dakota;"Fast Car Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, woah, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we will make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been working at a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living
[Pre-Chorus]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone

[Verse 2]
You see, my old man's got a problem
He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say, his body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

Why these niggas so jealous and looking sour over me?

Lie awake, two faced

We Don't Care;Sigala, The Vamps;"We Dont Care Lyrics[Verse:]
Too late give her the sign
I caught you eye, we can't rewind
It's too late, you hit the switch
She can't resist, we play a game all night

Try to keep my composure
Would be easy if i was sober
But you keep getting closer
And I'm feeling alright

[Chorus:]
Ohh well, I'm kinda drunk
But it's kinda fun, even if we know it's wrong
But we don't, we don't care
We don't care, we don't, we don't care
Oh only for the night
Only for the ride, even if it don't feel right
But we don't, we don't care
We don't care, we don't, we don't care
