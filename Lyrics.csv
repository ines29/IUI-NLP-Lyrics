Driving Home for Christma;Chris Rea;"I′m driving home for Christmas
Oh, I can't wait to see those faces
I′m driving home for Christmas, yeah
Well, I'm moving down that line

And it's been so long
But I will be there
I sing this song
To pass the time away
Driving in my car
Driving home for Christmas

It′s gonna take some time, but I′ll get there
Top to toe in tailbacks
Oh, I got red lights all around
But soon there'll be a freeway, yeah
Get my feet on holy ground


So I sing for you
Though you can′t hear me
When I get through
And feel you near me
Driving in my car
I'm driving home for Christmas

Driving home for Christmas
With a thousand memories
I take a look at the driver next to me
He′s just the same
Just the same

Top to toe in tailbacks
Oh, I got red lights all around
I'm driving home for Christmas, yeah
Get my feet on holy ground

So I sing for you
Though you can′t hear me
When I get through
Oh and feel you near me
Driving in my car
Driving home for Christmas


Driving home for Christmas
With a thousand memories
I take look at the driver next to me
He's just the same
He's driving home, driving home"
As It Was;Harry Styles;"Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you!

Holdin′ me back
Gravity's holdin′ me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?

Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I′m the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh

In this world, it′s just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it′s just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it′s not the same


Answer the phone
Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?

Ringin′ the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh

In this world, it′s just us
You know it′s not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it′s not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet
I don′t wanna talk about the way that it was
Leave America, two kids follow her
I don't wanna talk about who′s doin' it first

(Hey!)

As it was
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was"
Last Chrismas;Wham!;"Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I′ll give it to someone special

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (you gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (special)

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it′s been a year, it doesn't surprise me

""Merry Christmas,"" I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying ""I love you,"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you′d fool me again


Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (you gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I′ll give it to someone special (special)

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (special)

Oh
Oh, oh, baby

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I′m hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Ooh, ooh, now I've found a real love
You′ll never fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (you gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (special)


Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I′ll give it to someone special (special!)

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you mine)
A man under cover, but you tore him apart
Maybe next year, we'll give it to someone
I'll give it to someone special (special!)
So long!"
