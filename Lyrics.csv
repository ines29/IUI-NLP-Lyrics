Girls Just Want to Have Fun; Cyndi Lauper feat. Puffy AmiYumi;"I come home, in the morning light
My mother says ""When you gonna live your life right?""
Oh momma dear, we?re not the fortunate ones
And girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun...

The phone rings, in the middle of the night,
My father yells ""What you gonna do with your life?""
Oh daddy dear, you know you're still number one,
But girls they wanna have fun,
Oh girls just wanna have

That?s all they really want...
Some fun...
When the working day is done
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna (girls) have fun (they want)
(Wanna have fun)
(Girls)
(Wanna have)


Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world
I wanna be the one to walk in the sun
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have

That's all they really want...
Is some fun...
When the working day is done
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have (girls) fun (they want)
(Wanna have fun)
(Girls)
(Wanna have)

They just wanna, they just wanna (girls)
They just wanna, they just wanna (Girls just wanna have fun)
Oh girls

Girls just wanna have fun
They just wanna, they just wanna,
They just wanna, they just wanna (Girls)
They just wanna, they just wanna (Girls just wanna have fun)
Girls, girls just wanna have fun


When the workin'
When the working day is done
Oh, when the working day is done
Oh, girls
Girls just wanna have fun

They just wanna, they just wanna (girls)
They just wanna, they just wanna (Girls just wanna have fun)
Oh, girls

Girls just wanna have fu-un
(They just wanna, they just wanna)
When the workin?,
When the working day is done, (They just wanna, they just wanna)
Oh, when the working day is done (Oh, girls)
(Girls just wanna have fun)
Oh, girls
Girls just wanna have fun

Good as Hell;Lizzo;"I do my hair toss, check my nails
Baby how you feeling? (Feeling good as hell)
Hair toss, check my nails
Baby how you feeling? (Feeling good as hell)

Woo child, tired of the bullshit
Go on dust your shoulders off, keep it moving
Yes, Lord, tryna get some new shit
In there, swimwear, going-to-the-pool shit
Come now, come dry your eyes
You know you a star, you can touch the sky
I know that it?s hard but you have to try
If you need advice, let me simplify

If he don't love you anymore
Just walk your fine ass out the door

I do my hair toss, check my nails
Baby how you feeling? (Feeling good as hell)
Hair toss, check my nails
Baby how you feeling? (Feeling good as hell)
Woo girl, need to kick off your shoes


Got to take a deep breath, time to focus on you
All the big fights, long nights that you been through
I got a bottle of tequila I been saving for you
Boss up and change your life
You can have it all, no sacrifice
I know he did you wrong, we can make it right
So go and let it all hang out tonight

?Cause he don't love you anymore
So walk your fine ass out the door

We Will Rock You;Queen;"Buddy, you?re a boy, make a big noise
Playing in the street, gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on your face, you big disgrace
Kicking your can all over the place, singin'

We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

Buddy, you?re a young man, hard man
Shouting in the street, gonna take on the world someday
You got blood on your face, you big disgrace
Waving your banner all over the place


We will, we will rock you
Sing it out
We will, we will rock you

Buddy, you're an old man, poor man
Pleading with your eyes, gonna make you some peace someday
You got mud on your face, big disgrace
Somebody better put you back into your place

We will, we will rock you
Sing it
We will, we will rock you
Everybody
We will, we will rock you
Hmm
We will, we will rock you

Song 2;Blur;"Wooooo hoooo
Wooooo hoooo
Wooooo hoooo
Wooooo hoooo

I got my head checked
By a jumbo jet
It wasn?t easy
But nothing is
No

Wooooo hooooooo
When I feel heavy metal
Wooooo hooooooo
And I'm pins and I?m needles
Wooooo hooooooo


Well, I lie and I'm easy
All of the time, but I am never sure
Why I need you
Pleased to meet you

I got my head down
When I was young
It's not my problem
It?s not my problem

Wooooo hooooooo
When I feel heavy metal
Wooooo hooooooo
And I?m pins and I'm needles
Wooooo hooooooo

Well, I lie and I?m easy
All of the time but I am never sure
Why I need you
Pleased to meet you

Remember the Name;Fort Minor;"You ready?

Let?s go!

Yeah!
For those of you that want to know what we're all about
It?s like this y'all, c'mon!

This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

Mike, he doesn?t need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard, whether it?s the beat or the mic
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him

But fuck 'em, he knows the code
It?s not about the salary, it's all about reality and makin? some noise
Makin' the story, makin? sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down Tak's pickin' it up, let?s go


Who the hell is he anyway? He never really talks much
Never concerned with status but still leavin? them starstruck
Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact
That many misjudge him because he makes a livin' from writin? raps

Put it together himself, now the picture connects
Never askin' for someone?s help, but to get some respect
He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
And now it all unfolds, the skill of an artist

This is twenty percent skill, eighty percent beer
Be a hundred percent clear ?cause Ryu is ill
Who would've thought he'd be the one to set the west in flames?
Then I heard him wreck it with The Crystal Method, Name of the Game

Came back dropped Megadef, took ?em to church
I like Bleach, man, Ryu had the stupidest verse
This dude is the truth, now everybody givin? him guest spots
His stock's through the roof I heard he fuckin? with S. Dot

This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name


They call him ""Ryu, The Sick"" and he's spittin? fire with Mike
Got him out the dryer, he's hot, found him in Fort Minor with Tak
What a fuckin? nihilist porcupine, he's a prick, he's a cock
The type women want to be with and rappers hope he gets shot

Eight years in the makin? patiently waitin? to blow
Now the record with Shinoda's takin? over the globe
He's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope
You won?t believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat

Tak, he?s not your everyday on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got, makin' his way to the top
He often gets a comment on his name, people keep asking him
""Was it given at birth or does it stand for an acronym?""

No, he?s livin? proof got him rockin' the booth
He?ll get you buzzin' quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they doin? give a hundred percent

Forget Mike, nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
It seems like he's never got time
Because he writes every note and he writes every line
And I?ve seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind

It's like a design is written in his head every time
Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
And those mother fuckers he runs with, those kids that he signed
Ridiculous, without even tryin', how do they do it?

This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

Yeah!

Can't Hold Us;Macklemore & Ryan Lewis;"Ay, ay, ay
Good to see you
Come on in, let?s go

Yeah, let's go, hahaha

Alright, alright, okay, uh
Alright, okay, alright, okay

Return of the Mack
Get ?em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet and checking a new hit me, get up

Thrift Shop, pimp strut walking
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope, nope, y'all can?t copy, yup

Bad, moonwalking, and this here is our party
My posse?s been on Broadway, and we did it our way, grown music
I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet I'm on

 

Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town

Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustlin?
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen with the four-track buzzing
Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crushin'

Labels out here, nah, they can?t tell me nothing
We give that to the people, spread it across the country
Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothing
We give it to the people, spread it across the country

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we?ll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can?t hold us

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we?ll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can?t hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I?m so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you


Y?all can't stop me
Go hard like I got an 808 in my heart beat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw

Tell me go up, gone
Deuces, goodbye, I?ve got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar?ll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now, sing that song, and it goes like

Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure gain humility, and now we keep marching, I said

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it?s over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can?t hold us

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it?s over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

And so we put our hands up

And so we put our hands up

Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oooh, let?s go
Na na na na na na na na
Heeeeey, and all my people say
Na na na na na na na na
Heeeeey, and all my people say
Na na na na na na na na
Oooooh, and all my people say
Na na na na na na na na
Mack-le-oh-oh-oh-oh-more

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we?ll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can?t hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we?ll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can?t hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us";146
I Will Survive;Gloria Gaynor;"At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinkin? I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along

And so you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second you?d be back to bother me

Go on now, go walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren?t you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I?d crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?


Oh no not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I?ll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And I?ve got all my love to give
And I'll survive
I will survive
Hey, hey

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Kept tryin? hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high

And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free
But now I'm savin? all my lovin? for someone who's lovin? me

Go on now, go walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you?re not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I?d crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?


Oh no not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I?ve got all my life to live
I?ve got all my love to give
And I'll survive
I will survive
Oh

Go on now, go walk out the door
Just turn around now
?Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren?t you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I?d lay down and die?

Oh no not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
I?ve got all my love to give
And I?ll survive
I will survive

The Final Countdown ;Europe;"We?re leaving together
But still it's farewell
And maybe we?ll come back

We're leaving ground
Will things ever be the same again?

The final countdown

Ohh
We?re heading for Venus and still we stand tall
?Cause maybe they've seen us and welcome us all, yea
With so many light years to go and things to be found

Flashdance... What…;Irene Cara;"First when there?s nothing
But a slow glowing dream
That your fear seems to hide
Deep inside your mind
All alone I have cried
Silent tears full of pride
In a world made of steel
Made of stone
Well, I hear the music
Close my eyes
Feel the rhythm
Wrap around
Take a hold of my heart
What a feeling
Being's believing
I can have it all
Now I?m dancing for my life
Take your passion
And make it happen
Pictures come alive


You can dance right through your life
Now I hear the music
Close my eyes
I am rhythm
In a flash
It takes hold of my heart
What a feeling
Being's believing
I can have it all
Now I'm dancing for my life
Take your passion
And make it happen
Pictures come alive
You can dance right through your life
What a feeling
What a feeling (I am music now)
Being?s believing (I am rhythm now)
Pictures come alive
You can dance right through your life
What a feeling (I can really have it all)
What a feeling (pictures come alive when I call)
I can have it all (I can really have it all)
Have it all (pictures come alive when I call)

Eye of the Tiger;Survivor;"Rising up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I?m back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive
So many times it happens too fast
You trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive

It?s the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger

Face to face, out in the heat
Hanging tough, staying hungry
They stack the odds ?til we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive


It?s the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he?s watching us all with the eye of the tiger

Rising up, straight to the top
Had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop
Just a man and his will to survive

It?s the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he?s watching us all with the eye of the tiger

The eye of the tiger

The eye of the tiger

The eye of the tiger

The eye of the tiger";109

Came to party 'til I came no more
Celebrate ?cause that's all I know
Tip the groupies takin? off their clothes
Grand finale like Superbowl
Go hard, run the show
That's right, while I've got money to blow
More lights, more ice when I walk in the door
No hype, do it big all over the globe

I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feelin? me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the

Hoping my feelings, they would drown

Mama Said;Lukas Graham;"When Mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we were good kids
And Daddy told us, ""Never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun""
?Cause we were good kids

Remember asking both my mom and dad
Why we never traveled to exotic lands
We only ever really visit friends
Nothing to tell when the summer ends
We never really went buying clothes
Folks were passing on the stuff in plenty loads
New shoes once a year and then
Out to play ball so we could ruin them


When Mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we were good kids
And Daddy told us, ""Never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun""
'Cause we were good kids

Don?t get me wrong I didn't have it bad
I got enough loving from my mom and dad
But I don't think they really understood
When I said that I wanted the deal in Hollywood
I told them I?ll be singing on TV
The other kids were calling me a wannabe
The older kids, they started bugging me
But now they?re all standing right in front of me

When Mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we were good kids
And Daddy told us, ""Never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun""
'Cause we were good kids


I know which place I?m from
I know my home
When I'm in doubt and struggling
That?s where I go
An old friend can give advice
When new friends only know a half story
That's why I always keep ?em tight
And why I'm okay
I said I'm okay
You know what my mama said?
You know what she told me?

My Mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we were good kids
And Daddy told us, ""Never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun""

2U;David Guetta, Justin Biber;"No limit in the sky
That I won?t fly for ya (for ya, for ya, for ya)
No amount of tears in my eyes
That I won't cry for ya (for ya), oh no
With every breath that I take
I want you to share that air with me
There?s no promise that I won't keep
I'll climb a mountain, there?s none too steep

When it comes to you
There?s no crime
Let's take both of our souls
And intertwine

When it comes to you
Don?t be blind
Watch me speak from my heart
When it comes to you
Comes to you
Want you to share that

Cupid ain't a lie
Arrow got your name on it, oh yeah
Don?t miss out on a love
And regret yourself on it, oh (oh, oh)
Open up your mind, clear your head
Ain't gotta wake up to an empty bed
Share my life, it?s yours to keep
Now that I give to you all of me, oh

When it comes to you
There's no crime
Let's take both of our souls

Not Afraid;Eminem;"Yeah, It's been a ride...
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're trying to get out, just follow me
I'll get you there


You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take this thing out these words before I say 'em
Cause ain't no way I'm let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say 'em or do something I do it, I don't give a damn
What you think, I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if a thing's stopping me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
No if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shit'n
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shit's his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road

Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that fuck your fillings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehhhh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground


Relax, I ain't going back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack BLAOW
Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't
This fucking black cloud still follow's me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!

I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, Imma face my demons
I'm manning up, Imma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realise what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead
No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise
To focus only on handling my responsibility's as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazed and

I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road";81

I need A Doctor;Dr. Dre, Eminem, Skylar Grey;"I?m about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I?m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I?m sayin? that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day it?s just so grey and black


Hope, I just need a ray of that
'Cause no one sees my vision when I play it for ?em
They just say it's wack, but they don?t know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don?t see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fightin? you
It's dark, let me turn on the lights
And brighten me and enlighten you

I don?t think you realise what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue, 'cause me and you were like a crew
I was like your sidekick, you gon? either wanna fight
When I get off this fuckin' mic, or you gon? hug me
But I'm outta options, there's nothin? else I can do ?cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You?ve been gone for so long
I'm runnin? out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I?m puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin? lazy
Or you don?t believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form


Can't make a decision, you keep questionin? yourself
Second guessin' and it?s almost like you're beggin? for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin? be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin? you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin? label, let's tell the truth!
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I?m cryin' in this booth

You saved my life, now maybe it?s my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith
And you ain?t givin? up on me, get up, Dre!
I'm dyin?, I need you, come back for fuck's sake!

I?m about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I?m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
(I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life)

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don?t see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends! All I need is him

Fuckin? backstabbers!
When the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin? wrath of Aftermath, faggots!
You gon' see us in our lab jackets
And ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots!
And the cracker?s ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers, I?m back, bastards!
One more CD and then I'm packin' up my bags, and as
I?m leavin?, I'll guarantee they?ll scream
""Dre, don't leave us like that, man!"" ?cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You?ve been gone for so long

Power;Kanye West;"I?m living in that 21st Century, doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music
No one man should have all that power

The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I?m tripping off the power
(21st-Century schizoid man)
The system broken, the school is closed, the prison's open
We ain't got nothing to lose, motherfucker we rolling

Huh? Motherfucker we rolling
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I?ll see you in the morning
Huh? I?ll see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment


No one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I?m tripping off the power
Till then, fuck that, the world's ours

And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say

(21st-Century schizoid man)

Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically they can kiss my asshole
I?m an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon

My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
And I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, he's so fucking gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn?t open up my own vault

My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me


As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece
Thinking

No one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I?m tripping off the powder
Till then, fuck that, the world?s ours
And they say, and they say

And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say

Colin Powells, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fucking nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well that?s a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of the day, god damn it I'm killing this shit
I know damn well y?all feeling this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch, I?m on my own dick

I ain't gotta power trip, who you going home with?
How 'Ye doing? I?m surviving
I was drinking earlier, now I?m driving
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hiding?
I got the power to make your life so exciting

Now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I?m letting everything go

There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions have an echo in so much space

And when you?re out there without care

But it wasn't because I didn?t know enough
I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly


And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice
Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you
Who do you think you are
Ha ha ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control

I think you?re crazy
I think you?re crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on the limb
And all I remember is thinking I want to be like them

Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little it looked like fun
And it?s no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I?m done

But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you?re crazy
Maybe we're crazy

And her heart is breakin? in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won?t say goodbye anymore

Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied, oh

Pretending to feel the same

I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe

Just the ache of knowing everything was gonna change
I got so close to love with you, my dear
I don't miss you
I miss the way you made me feel";110
Following the Sun;SUPER-Hi, NEEKA;"Maybe I don?t wanna know
The way home
Taking on a journey
I've got places to go
Wanna chase a miracle?
It?s possible
You just gotta open the door

Darling, it's cold out there
Don't fear the road
Just come along with me
You?re not alone out there
Let?s write a song, make up the melody

If you're looking for me baby
You know you can find me
Following the sun
Somewhere running up my heartbeat
I don?t look behind me
Following the sun

Following the sun


Come and give your love away
Don't play it safe
I?ma let you fall but I won't let you break
Wanna chase a sunset
Are you ready yet?
We won?t get this chance every day

Darling, it's cold out there
Don't fear the road
Just come along with me
You?re not alone out there
Let?s write a song, make up the melody

If you're looking for me baby
You know you can find me
Following the sun
Somewhere running up my heartbeat
I don?t look behind me
Following the sun

Following the sun

Following the sun

You can lean on...
You can lean on me
You can lean on...
You can lean on me


If you're looking for me baby
You know you can find me
Following the sun
Somewhere running up my heartbeat
I don?t look behind me
Following the sun

Following the sun

Following the sun

You can lean on...
You can lean on me
You can lean on...
You can lean on me";127
Serotonin;Tom Walker;"My father told me
""Can?t wake up happy everyday
Can't have the sun without the rain
Can?t have the moments where you're truly on top of the world
Without the moments where you're down in the dirt""

It?s something they don?t really teach you in school
About anxiety, depression and the weight of the world
We're all looking for some gratification
A little love, a little validation
That?s why

I'm glad I found someone like you
To see the sadness and the truth
I?m glad I found someone like you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I feel your touch deeper than my skin
Every chemical rushing in
Now I've found your love, I?m coming up again
Like serotonin, serotonin


Like a pill takes off the edge
Like a smoker's last cigarette
Now I've found your love, I?m coming up again
Like serotonin, serotonin

My father told me
""That?s the thing about life
It only matters who you have by your side
Not the money or the cars that you're driving
That?s some temporary high shit
Always chasing a climax""
That's why

I?m glad I found someone like you
Whose seen the sadness and the truth
I'm glad I found someone like you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I feel your touch deeper than my skin
Every chemical rushing in
Now I?ve found your love, I'm coming up again
Like serotonin, serotonin

Like a pill takes off the edge
Like a smoker's last cigarette
Now I?ve found your love, I?m coming up again
Like serotonin, serotonin


Like serotonin, serotonin

I feel your touch deeper than my skin
Every chemical rushing in
Now I've found your love, I?m coming up again
Like serotonin, serotonin

Like a pill that takes off the edge
Like a smoker's last cigarette
Now I?ve found your love, I'm coming up again
Like serotonin, serotonin

Like serotonin, serotonin
Like serotonin";164
