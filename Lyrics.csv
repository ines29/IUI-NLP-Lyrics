Girls Just Want to Have Fun; Cyndi Lauper feat. Puffy AmiYumi;"I come home, in the morning light
My mother says ""When you gonna live your life right?""
Oh momma dear, we?re not the fortunate ones
And girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun...

The phone rings, in the middle of the night,
My father yells ""What you gonna do with your life?""
Oh daddy dear, you know you're still number one,
But girls they wanna have fun,
Oh girls just wanna have

That?s all they really want...
Some fun...
When the working day is done
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna (girls) have fun (they want)
(Wanna have fun)
(Girls)
(Wanna have)


Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world
I wanna be the one to walk in the sun
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have

That's all they really want...
Is some fun...
When the working day is done
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have (girls) fun (they want)
(Wanna have fun)
(Girls)
(Wanna have)

They just wanna, they just wanna (girls)
They just wanna, they just wanna (Girls just wanna have fun)
Oh girls

Girls just wanna have fun
They just wanna, they just wanna,
They just wanna, they just wanna (Girls)
They just wanna, they just wanna (Girls just wanna have fun)
Girls, girls just wanna have fun


When the workin'
When the working day is done
Oh, when the working day is done
Oh, girls
Girls just wanna have fun

They just wanna, they just wanna (girls)
They just wanna, they just wanna (Girls just wanna have fun)
Oh, girls

Girls just wanna have fu-un
(They just wanna, they just wanna)
When the workin?,
When the working day is done, (They just wanna, they just wanna)
Oh, when the working day is done (Oh, girls)
(Girls just wanna have fun)
Oh, girls
Girls just wanna have fun

Good as Hell;Lizzo;"I do my hair toss, check my nails
Baby how you feeling? (Feeling good as hell)
Hair toss, check my nails
Baby how you feeling? (Feeling good as hell)

Woo child, tired of the bullshit
Go on dust your shoulders off, keep it moving
Yes, Lord, tryna get some new shit
In there, swimwear, going-to-the-pool shit
Come now, come dry your eyes
You know you a star, you can touch the sky
I know that it?s hard but you have to try
If you need advice, let me simplify

If he don't love you anymore
Just walk your fine ass out the door

I do my hair toss, check my nails
Baby how you feeling? (Feeling good as hell)
Hair toss, check my nails
Baby how you feeling? (Feeling good as hell)
Woo girl, need to kick off your shoes


Got to take a deep breath, time to focus on you
All the big fights, long nights that you been through
I got a bottle of tequila I been saving for you
Boss up and change your life
You can have it all, no sacrifice
I know he did you wrong, we can make it right
So go and let it all hang out tonight

?Cause he don't love you anymore
So walk your fine ass out the door

We Will Rock You;Queen;"Buddy, you?re a boy, make a big noise
Playing in the street, gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on your face, you big disgrace
Kicking your can all over the place, singin'

We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

Buddy, you?re a young man, hard man
Shouting in the street, gonna take on the world someday
You got blood on your face, you big disgrace
Waving your banner all over the place


We will, we will rock you
Sing it out
We will, we will rock you

Buddy, you're an old man, poor man
Pleading with your eyes, gonna make you some peace someday
You got mud on your face, big disgrace
Somebody better put you back into your place

We will, we will rock you
Sing it
We will, we will rock you
Everybody
We will, we will rock you
Hmm
We will, we will rock you

Song 2;Blur;"Wooooo hoooo
Wooooo hoooo
Wooooo hoooo
Wooooo hoooo

I got my head checked
By a jumbo jet
It wasn?t easy
But nothing is
No

Wooooo hooooooo
When I feel heavy metal
Wooooo hooooooo
And I'm pins and I?m needles
Wooooo hooooooo


Well, I lie and I'm easy
All of the time, but I am never sure
Why I need you
Pleased to meet you

I got my head down
When I was young
It's not my problem
It?s not my problem

Wooooo hooooooo
When I feel heavy metal
Wooooo hooooooo
And I?m pins and I'm needles
Wooooo hooooooo

Well, I lie and I?m easy
All of the time but I am never sure
Why I need you
Pleased to meet you

Remember the Name;Fort Minor;"You ready?

Let?s go!

Yeah!
For those of you that want to know what we're all about
It?s like this y'all, c'mon!

This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

Mike, he doesn?t need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard, whether it?s the beat or the mic
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him

But fuck 'em, he knows the code
It?s not about the salary, it's all about reality and makin? some noise
Makin' the story, makin? sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down Tak's pickin' it up, let?s go


Who the hell is he anyway? He never really talks much
Never concerned with status but still leavin? them starstruck
Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact
That many misjudge him because he makes a livin' from writin? raps

Put it together himself, now the picture connects
Never askin' for someone?s help, but to get some respect
He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
And now it all unfolds, the skill of an artist

This is twenty percent skill, eighty percent beer
Be a hundred percent clear ?cause Ryu is ill
Who would've thought he'd be the one to set the west in flames?
Then I heard him wreck it with The Crystal Method, Name of the Game

Came back dropped Megadef, took ?em to church
I like Bleach, man, Ryu had the stupidest verse
This dude is the truth, now everybody givin? him guest spots
His stock's through the roof I heard he fuckin? with S. Dot

This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name


They call him ""Ryu, The Sick"" and he's spittin? fire with Mike
Got him out the dryer, he's hot, found him in Fort Minor with Tak
What a fuckin? nihilist porcupine, he's a prick, he's a cock
The type women want to be with and rappers hope he gets shot

Eight years in the makin? patiently waitin? to blow
Now the record with Shinoda's takin? over the globe
He's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope
You won?t believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat

Tak, he?s not your everyday on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got, makin' his way to the top
He often gets a comment on his name, people keep asking him
""Was it given at birth or does it stand for an acronym?""

No, he?s livin? proof got him rockin' the booth
He?ll get you buzzin' quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they doin? give a hundred percent

Forget Mike, nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
It seems like he's never got time
Because he writes every note and he writes every line
And I?ve seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind

It's like a design is written in his head every time
Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
And those mother fuckers he runs with, those kids that he signed
Ridiculous, without even tryin', how do they do it?

This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

Yeah!

Can't Hold Us;Macklemore & Ryan Lewis;"Ay, ay, ay
Good to see you
Come on in, let?s go

Yeah, let's go, hahaha

Alright, alright, okay, uh
Alright, okay, alright, okay

Return of the Mack
Get ?em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet and checking a new hit me, get up

Thrift Shop, pimp strut walking
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope, nope, y'all can?t copy, yup

Bad, moonwalking, and this here is our party
My posse?s been on Broadway, and we did it our way, grown music
I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet I'm on

 

Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town

Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustlin?
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen with the four-track buzzing
Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crushin'

Labels out here, nah, they can?t tell me nothing
We give that to the people, spread it across the country
Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothing
We give it to the people, spread it across the country

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we?ll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can?t hold us

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we?ll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can?t hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I?m so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you


Y?all can't stop me
Go hard like I got an 808 in my heart beat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw

Tell me go up, gone
Deuces, goodbye, I?ve got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar?ll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now, sing that song, and it goes like

Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure gain humility, and now we keep marching, I said

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it?s over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can?t hold us

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it?s over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

And so we put our hands up

And so we put our hands up

Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oooh, let?s go
Na na na na na na na na
Heeeeey, and all my people say
Na na na na na na na na
Heeeeey, and all my people say
Na na na na na na na na
Oooooh, and all my people say
Na na na na na na na na
Mack-le-oh-oh-oh-oh-more

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we?ll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can?t hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we?ll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can?t hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us";146
I Will Survive;Gloria Gaynor;"At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinkin? I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along

And so you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second you?d be back to bother me

Go on now, go walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren?t you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I?d crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?


Oh no not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I?ll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And I?ve got all my love to give
And I'll survive
I will survive
Hey, hey

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Kept tryin? hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high

And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free
But now I'm savin? all my lovin? for someone who's lovin? me

Go on now, go walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you?re not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I?d crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?


Oh no not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I?ve got all my life to live
I?ve got all my love to give
And I'll survive
I will survive
Oh

Go on now, go walk out the door
Just turn around now
?Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren?t you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I?d lay down and die?

Oh no not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
I?ve got all my love to give
And I?ll survive
I will survive

The Final Countdown ;Europe;"We?re leaving together
But still it's farewell
And maybe we?ll come back

We're leaving ground
Will things ever be the same again?

The final countdown

Ohh
We?re heading for Venus and still we stand tall
?Cause maybe they've seen us and welcome us all, yea
With so many light years to go and things to be found

Flashdance... What…;Irene Cara;"First when there?s nothing
But a slow glowing dream
That your fear seems to hide
Deep inside your mind
All alone I have cried
Silent tears full of pride
In a world made of steel
Made of stone
Well, I hear the music
Close my eyes
Feel the rhythm
Wrap around
Take a hold of my heart
What a feeling
Being's believing
I can have it all
Now I?m dancing for my life
Take your passion
And make it happen
Pictures come alive


You can dance right through your life
Now I hear the music
Close my eyes
I am rhythm
In a flash
It takes hold of my heart
What a feeling
Being's believing
I can have it all
Now I'm dancing for my life
Take your passion
And make it happen
Pictures come alive
You can dance right through your life
What a feeling
What a feeling (I am music now)
Being?s believing (I am rhythm now)
Pictures come alive
You can dance right through your life
What a feeling (I can really have it all)
What a feeling (pictures come alive when I call)
I can have it all (I can really have it all)
Have it all (pictures come alive when I call)

Eye of the Tiger;Survivor;"Rising up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I?m back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive
So many times it happens too fast
You trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive

It?s the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger

Face to face, out in the heat
Hanging tough, staying hungry
They stack the odds ?til we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive


It?s the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he?s watching us all with the eye of the tiger

Rising up, straight to the top
Had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop
Just a man and his will to survive

It?s the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he?s watching us all with the eye of the tiger

The eye of the tiger

The eye of the tiger

The eye of the tiger

The eye of the tiger";109
